## Hi there, I am Bruno 👋
I was born in [Oruro](https://www.bolivianlife.com/department-of-oruro/), a small city in Bolivia. I studied in Anglo American School and graduated early as soon as I received information about United World Colleges (UWC).
Now, I am studying my last term at Pearson College UWC, located in Victoria, BC, Canada. 

### 📚 My Curricular Activities 📖
I am also taking the IBDP, which is probably the most competitive curriculum in the whole world. (Please Help)

### 🤿 My extracurriculars 👨‍💻
I love (scuba) diving. I enjoy doing stuff related to coding and back-end (I particularly do not always enjoy front-end). I also
started to work on research for Pearson College UWC. Studying the underwater life and applying Chemistry to it! 🌱
**Yes**, some projects I have are private because I do not really want them to be released to the public. **No**, these projects are not hosted in any cloud service,
I only use GitHub to store them in the cloud in case my computer blows up. 

### 🔭 GitHub 🤖
GitHub has been an special place for me as it allowed me to work on different independent projects, specially [DragonMineZ](https://github.com/DragonMineZ/dragonminez).
- I'm currently learning C# related to game development
- I am "sort of" proficient in Java.
- I was proficient in Python but due to my focus in Java I mostly stopped coding in python a while ago. I did some projects with it though.
- I know and understand HTML and CSS, I know PHP a little bit, but sometimes I let ChatGPT do the rest.
