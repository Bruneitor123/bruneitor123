## Hi there, I am Bruno ðŸ‘‹
I was born in Oruro, a small city in Bolivia. I studied in Anglo American School and graduated early as soon as I received information about United World Colleges (UWC).
Now, I am studying my last term at Pearson College UWC, located in Victoria, BC, Canada. 

### My Curricular Activities ðŸ“š
I am also taking the IBDP, which is probably the most competitive curriculum in the whole world.

### My extracurriculars ðŸ¤¿
I love (scuba) diving. I enjoy doing stuff related to coding and back-end (I particularly do not like front-end).

### GitHub ðŸ”­
GitHub has been an special place for me as it allowed me to work on different independent projects, specially DragonMineZ.
- I'm currently learning C# related to game development
- I am "sort of" proficient in Java.
- I was proficient in Python but due to my focus in Java I mostly stopped coding in python a while ago. I did some projects with it though.
