## Hi there, I am Bruno 👋

I was born in Oruro, Bolivia, a high-altitude city known for its mining history and vibrant cultural traditions (like the carnival!). I finished high school at Anglo American School in Oruro and completed the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at Pearson College UWC on Vancouver Island, Canada. I am now a first-year student at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Engineering and building a path toward aerospace engineering.

## 📚 Academics

At Earlham, I am in my freshman year in the Engineering program, which combines a strong foundation in math, physics, and engineering with liberal arts skills like communication and ethical reasoning. I am especially interested in how these fundamentals connect to aerospace topics such as fluid mechanics, structures, and control systems that are core to aircraft and spacecraft design.

Before Earlham, I completed the IB Diploma at Pearson College UWC, a demanding pre-university curriculum that strengthened my quantitative reasoning, research abilities, and ability to work under academic pressure. That experience, together with UWC’s global and community-focused environment, strongly influences how I think about using engineering to solve real-world problems.

## 🤿 Extracurriculars and projects 👨‍💻

Outside of class, I like working at the intersection of technical problem-solving, hands-on work, and community. On campus, I work as an Audio Visual Technician at Earlham, setting up and operating AV systems for events, troubleshooting equipment, and helping make sure live presentations run smoothly from a technical perspective.

In my engineering coursework and personal tinkering, I have worked on:
- An automated toy-boat prototype that can turn by itself, exploring simple control, motion, and stability in water.
- An automated item sorter concept for a recycling plant, designed to separate materials using sensors and basic mechanical systems.

Previously, I spent multiple seasons working as a house painter in Victoria, BC, which taught me a lot about safety, teamwork, attention to detail, and getting things done in challenging physical conditions. I also volunteer with UWC Bolivia, helping with selection rounds, meetings, and maintaining the organization’s online presence.

## 🔭 GitHub and engineering interests 🤖

GitHub is where many of my projects live, including work like [DragonMineZ](https://github.com/DragonMineZ/dragonminez) and several private repositories that I mainly use for version control and backups. I am currently learning C# for game development, have “sort of” solid experience with Java from backend and game-related work, and have used Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and databases like MySQL and MariaDB in various projects.

I especially enjoy:
- Building bots and automation tools for online communities and games.
- Working on backend logic and APIs more than purely aesthetic front-end work.
- Prototyping small engineering systems that combine code, hardware, and physical models as a stepping stone toward aerospace-focused projects.

I am a native Spanish speaker, fluent in English (C1 level), and have limited working proficiency in French, which helps in international, collaborative environments.
